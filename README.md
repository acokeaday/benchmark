# benchmark
Unattended benchmarking making use of 3 benchmarking tools consisting of the following: 

Geekbench5 - https://www.geekbench.com/
fio - https://fio.readthedocs.io/
ioping - https://github.com/koct9i/ioping

These benchmarking tools are not written by me. 

This script simply allows the 3 tools to run with a single command storing the results in a single file. 

Feel free to reach out if there are any suggestions.

How to use: 

	wget https://github.com/acokeaday/benchmark/blob/master/benchmark.sh
	./benchmark
